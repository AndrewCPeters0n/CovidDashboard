## Figures and Tables
### 1. Overview table
The first table created in DataDisplay.py shows the top 100 countries with new Covid deaths.
Any category can be used to sort the table, and the data shown is: 
    * Country Name
    * Total Country Deaths
    * New Deaths
    * Deaths / Million
    * New Deaths / Million

### 2. Interactive Figure
The top figure in our dashboard is a map plot of each of the 100 countries. It displays hovering data about the new deaths, along with a legend on the right to give the user an idea of where in the world the most new deaths are occuring. 
The longitude and latitude are the axis and are labeled, and scrolling and panning are included as tools to look over data.
The hover tool indicated the country name, new deaths, and cumulative deaths. 

### 3. Interactive Legend Graph
The last figure in the bottom right of our dashboard goes over the data for the last three days of the highest new deaths. It allows users to hide the number of countries by clicking on the legend.
